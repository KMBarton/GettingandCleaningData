The script run_analysis.R was created to analyse data collected from the accelerometers of 
samsung Galaxy S smartphones from 30 study participants. The participants were split into
two groups, the training group and the test group who had 21 and 9 participants, respectively.
Data was recorded for each participant while they performed six tasks including laying, sitting, 
standing, walking, walking downstairs,and walking upstairs. Measurements were recorded in the X, Y,
and Z planes for each parameter that was recorded. The following parameters were documented 
from the obtained data:

For each of these parameters we have included the standard deviation, the mean, and the weighted
average of the frequency components, which is called the mean frequency, where available. Parameters
that start with a "t", are measurements of time and those that start with an "f" are frequency measurements.
According to the study information, " These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured 
at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth 
filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated 
into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth 
filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz." The following parameters were also calculated by averaging 
the signals in the signal window sample:

angle(tBodyAccMean,gravity)
angle(tBodyAccJerkMean),gravityMean)
angle(tBodyGyroMean,gravityMean)
angle(tBodyGyroJerkMean,gravityMean)
angle(X,gravityMean)
angle(Y,gravityMean)
angle(Z,gravityMean)

This script takes the raw data files, combines the test and training data into one file 
and labels the rows with both the participant details and the activity. It also applies
a descriptive name to each of the 86 variable columns. The script then melts the data using
activity and subject as ID variables. the dcast function is used to then create a tidy data
set that contains the mean for each variable for each activity for each subject and exports
this data set into a .csv file.
